Where 1 sets a diamond morphology which implies that diagonal elements are not considered as neighbors
And 2 sets a square mask, i.e. all elements are considered neighbors.

Sampling rate, related to the Nyquist conditions, which affects 
the range frequencies we can detect.

'''
Size of the FFT window, affects frequency granularity
'''
DEFAULT_WINDOW_SIZE = 4096

'''
Ratio by which each sequential window overlaps the last and the
next window. Higher overlap will allow a higher granularity of offset
matching, but potentially more fingerprints.
'''
DEFAULT_OVERLAP_RATIO = 0.5

'''
Degree to which a fingerprint can be paired with its neighbors--higher 
will cause more fingerprints, but potentially better accuracy.
'''
DEFAULT_FAN_VALUE = 15

'''
Minimum amplitude in spectrogram in order to be considered as a peak.
This can be raised to reduce number of fingerprints, but can also negatively
affect accuracy. 
'''
DEFAULT_AMP_MIN = 10

'''
Number of cells around an amplitude peak in the spectrogram in order
to consider it as a spectral peak. Higher values mean less
fingerprints and faster matching, but potentially affect accuracy.
'''
PEAK_NEIGHBORHOOD_SIZE = 20

'''
Sensitivity value, the higher value make a higher sensitivity 
and vice versa, affecting the choice of threshold value.
'''
SENSITIVITY = 0.1

'''
This parameter is the matrix percentage value used in the 
calculation of the threshold, which has an impact on the calculation of 
the threshold and needs to be adjusted appropriately according to the size of the dataset.

To avoid memory overflow, it is wiser to split the batch calculation.
Adjust it according to physical memory size.
